## Software Design

> "Read the specification of the software you want to build.
> Underline the verbs if you are after procedural code,
> the nouns if you aim for an object-oriented program".
>                                   _ Grady Booch


Circle the nouns and underline the verbs.  
The nouns become containers, structures, objects;  
the verbs become operations, actions, abilities.

In a functional design, the verbs are the primary focus;  
in an object-oriented design, the nouns are the primary focus.
