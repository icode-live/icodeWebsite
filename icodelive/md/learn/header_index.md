the science of <em>computer programming</em> and the techniques and skills of <em>coding</em>.

More particularly, iCODE ... 
it is good to practice problems solving and writing code. 
It is like daily workout. 
The programmer who wrote 1000 programs will be always better than one who wrote only 10

<h3>Linear Progression</h3>
iCODE-000  
level 0 the apprentice learner (Problem Solving, tools and Computer Language)  
level 1 the learning apprentice (Computer Science, Software Design)  
level 2 the practicing learner (demo and live-coding videos)  

iCODE-001  
level 3 the learning practitioner (invited to perform, meetup, convention)  
level 4 the practicing master (1 masterpiece on git)  
leval 5 the master practitioner (1 project with contributers  

iCODE-010  
level 6 the performing master (spotcoder: perform live where and whenever)  

iCODE-011  
level 7 the master performer (This is showbusiness: payed to perform)
