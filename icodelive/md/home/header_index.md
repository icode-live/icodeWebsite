<h2>Learn to code?</h2>
Code, coding, and programming means different things to different people.
After all, coding is hard, right? It takes time, effort, practice, real projects, trials 
and triumph.   
"Everybody needs to learn Code!" ... how are we to understand this rallying call?

Perhaps it is not a misguided or misguiding movement, 
<strong>if</strong> we understand coding as <em>a way of thinking and problem solving</em>, 
rather than just the relm of syntaxes, languages features and jobs of the future.

<h2>iCODE</h2>
Let's embrace the Art of <em>Thinking</em> and the skill of <strong><em>problem decomposition</em></strong>. 

Let's values the <strong>mastery</strong> of your creative <em>tools</em>, 
the <strong>science</strong> of <em>computer programming</em> 
and the <strong>techniques and skills</strong> of <em>coding</em>.

To these ends, let's use the web to become better at figuring out stuff for yourself.
<br/>
Let's practice problems solving and writing code.
<br/> 
Let's make it a regular workout. 

The programmer who wrote 100 programs will always be better than one who wrote only 1.
The programmer who contributed to 1 opensource project will always better be than one 
who wrote 1000 personal projects.

Whether you are a veteran programmer or a new coder, challenge yourself to Know what you are doing, why it works and why that way.
Think better, on purpose. Take the time to go fast ...
