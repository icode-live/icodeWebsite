thinking efficiency: Design and thought process and generally offline skills

coding proficiency:

> math is no longer about correct and incorrect answers.  It's also about how responses and results can be defended, explained, and justified using mathematical thinking.

## icode inspiration

icode gets its inspiration from the following sources

### Offline skills:

(critical, mathematical, computational) Thinking

#### Deliberate Thinking

#### Efficient Thinking

#### Mathematical Thinking

#### Computational Thinking

### Online skills:

SpotCoding; impromptu semi-rehearsed live performance

#### Live coding

Live coding is a performing arts form and a creativity technique centred upon the writing of source code and the use of interactive programming in an improvised way.

#### Interactive coding

Interactive coding also called Interactive programming is the procedure of writing parts of a program while it is already active. This focuses on the program text as the main interface for a running process, rather than an interactive application, where the program is designed in development cycles and used thereafter (usually by a so-called "user", in distinction to the "developer"). Consequently, here, the activity of writing a program becomes part of the program itself.

#### Competitive coding

Competitive coding.

#### Show and Tell coding

Convention, Academic, tutorial and workshop coding in various Programming Languages

##### Python
