### Online skills:

SpotCoding; impromptu semi-rehearsed live performance

#### Live coding

Live coding is a performing arts form and a creativity technique centred upon the writing of source code and the use of interactive programming in an improvised way.

#### Interactive coding

Interactive coding also called Interactive programming is the procedure of writing parts of a program while it is already active. This focuses on the program text as the main interface for a running process, rather than an interactive application, where the program is designed in development cycles and used thereafter (usually by a so-called "user", in distinction to the "developer"). Consequently, here, the activity of writing a program becomes part of the program itself.
